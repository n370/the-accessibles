# cross-platform-token-adapter

## Summary

Implements a tool that can transform the JSON generated by the theme-builder into artifacts that can be consumed by nearly any platform.
This is accomplished by using the open source tool [Style-Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/).
The adapter fixes the JSON supplied by the theme-builder and provides a config file that generates color design tokens that are ready to be consumed by the following platforms:

- Android (XML)
- iOS (Swift)
- Web (css variables)
- TypeScript

ℹ️ The current implementation was tested with the included "Sample" theme on theme builder and only transforms the color design tokens.

## How to run

To see magic happen, execute the follow steps:

1. `npm install`
1. `npm run build`
1. Explore the generated build artifacts (ready to be consume by the various platforms) in the `build` directory ✨

## Explanation

Here is a summary of the important files included in the application.

| file | description |
|-|-|
| `generated-tokens-replace-with-theme-builder-json.json` | This file is a direct copy-and-paste of the JSON on the "CODE" tab of the "Sample" theme in the theme-builder UI. This file can be replaced with the JSON from the theme-builder. |
| `tokens.js` | The **JSON copied from the theme-builder UI appears to be broken.** There are token values that reference missing values, such as "Core-Colors". This file adds the missing references that are required for the "Sample" theme. |
| `style-dictionary-config.js` | Configuration file for style-dictionary that sets up the various transforms and artifacts for the platforms. **Style-Dictionary supports more platforms, but the config file provides an example.** The config file also includes the code that allows Style-Dictionary to parse the JSON generated by the theme-builder. |

The artifacts generated in the `build` directory after running the tool, are ready to be consumed by the various platforms.
