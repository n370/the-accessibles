## Use Case Abstract

### Theme Builder API server modernization

After reading through the Theme Builder source code our team identified an opportunity to improve the backend server by changing the underlying technology being used to build it. Fastify is a modern open-source Node.js web server framework with first class Typescript support and a vibrant community.
### Style Dictionary integration

After looking at the JSON output generated by the Theme Builder our team identified and opportunity to use it as an input to another tool that automates the creation of stylesheets for multiple platforms not only the Web. The [Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/) is an open-source project that allows you to define styles once, in a way for any platform or language to consume.
